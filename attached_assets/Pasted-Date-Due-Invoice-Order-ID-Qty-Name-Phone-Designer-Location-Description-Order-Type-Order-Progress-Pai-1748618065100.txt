these hurdles, we have completed over 146 of the original 379 orders and are
working tirelessly to finish the rest
To ensure clarity and resolution, I am providing all customers with three options:
1 Wait for Completion: Your order will be completed in the current queue as
soon as possible
2 Pick Up and Hold: You may pick up your artwork and hold it until I am
ready to resume work on your order
3 Pick Up Without Refund: You may pick up your artwork now without a
refund, as substantial time, materials, and our labor have already been
invested
If you choose option 3, I will provide a waiver for you to sign upon pickup Please
use the questionnaire in the Calendly link below, to confirm your decision 1, 2, or
3 and book your appointment
I am committed to resolving this as quickly as possible while ensuring every
customer receives their artwork Thank you for your understanding and support
during this tough time

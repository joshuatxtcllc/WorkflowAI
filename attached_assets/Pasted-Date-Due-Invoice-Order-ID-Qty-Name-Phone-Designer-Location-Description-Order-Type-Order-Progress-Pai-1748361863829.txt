I want to personally thank you for your patience as we work to complete your
custom framing order The transition to our new location has been more
challenging than expected, with reduced space, staffing, and resources Despite
these hurdles, we have completed over 146 of the original 379 orders and are
working tirelessly to finish the rest
To ensure clarity and resolution, I am providing all customers with three options:
1 Wait for Completion: Your order will be completed in the current queue as
soon as possible
2 Pick Up and Hold: You may pick up your artwork and hold it until I am
ready to resume work on your order
3 Pick Up Without Refund: You may pick up your artwork now without a
refund, as substantial time, materials, and our labor have already been
invested
If you choose option 3, I will provide a waiver for you to sign upon pickup Please
use the questionnaire in the Calendly link below, to confirm your decision 1, 2, or
3 and book your appointment
I am committed to resolving this as quickly as possible while ensuring every
customer receives their artwork Thank you for your understanding and support
during this tough time

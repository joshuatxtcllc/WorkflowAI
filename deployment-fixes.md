- **Benefits**:
  - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
  - Consistent error handling across all integrations
  - Improved user experience during service outages

### 7. React Error Boundaries (`client/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Component-level error isolation
  - Automatic error reporting
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
- **Specialized Boundaries**:
  - Frame Catalog Error Boundary
  - Pricing Engine Error Boundary
  - Inventory Error Boundary
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents single component failures from crashing the entire application
  - Better user experience during frontend errors
  - Detailed error reporting for debugging

## Deployment Fixes Applied

### Build System Improvements
- **Issue**: Vite build timeouts and missing directories
- **Solution**: Created fallback build system with timeout handling
- **Files**: `build-simple.js`, `deploy-build.js`

### CSS Compilation Fixes
- **Issue**: Tailwind @apply directive compilation errors
- **Solution**: Fixed CSS processing and added fallback styles
- **Impact**: Eliminates build-time CSS errors

### Server Configuration
- **Issue**: Incorrect host binding for Cloud Run deployment
- **Solution**: Ensured server binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 for container environments
- **Impact**: Proper external accessibility in production

### Static File Serving
- **Issue**: Missing build artifacts in production
- **Solution**: Added proper dist/public/ directory structure
- **Impact**: Correct asset serving in deployed environment

## Integration Points Secured

### 1. TanStack Query + PostgreSQL
- **Protection**: Database circuit breaker with connection pooling
- **Fallback**: Cached responses and graceful degradation
- **Monitoring**: Query performance tracking and timeout detection

### 2. OpenAI API + Business Logic
- **Protection**: AI service circuit breaker with rate limit handling
- **Fallback**: Manual operation recommendations when AI unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Token usage tracking and response time monitoring

### 3. Stripe Webhooks + Order Processing
- **Protection**: Webhook retry logic and transaction isolation
- **Fallback**: Manual payment verification workflows
- **Monitoring**: Payment processing status and failure tracking

### 4. File Uploads + Storage
- **Protection**: Error boundaries around upload components
- **Fallback**: Local temporary storage when cloud unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Upload success rates and storage capacity

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- Query result caching through TanStack Query
- Stale-while-revalidate for better user experience
- Circuit breaker state caching to reduce overhead

### Batch Processing
- Database operations batched for efficiency
- SMS notifications sent in controlled batches
- Bulk operations with proper rate limiting

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Timeout controls for all external API calls
